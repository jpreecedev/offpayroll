# Offpayroll.org.uk

Clone of the website written for iOS using Swift.

This product was built purely because I wanted to learn Swift, I needed a project and I love this site, so why not.

Contact was made with the owners of the site but they didn't respond. [Contact me for more information.](https://jpreecedev.com/).

## Landing page

We have a landing page! Check out the landing page at [https://jpreecedev.github.io/offpayroll/docs/](https://jpreecedev.github.io/offpayroll/docs/). (Strictly just for fun!)

If you're double curious, we also have a video! [Check it out](https://jpreecedev.github.io/offpayroll/docs/offpayroll.mov).
